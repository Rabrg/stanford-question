On December 28, 2015, ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game, marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl.
Unlike NBC and John Fox, CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game (though per league policy, a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers).
The game was called by ESPN Deportes' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Harvey Martin and Raul Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe.
ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage, while Harvey Martin, Raul Allegre, and John Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN's SportsCenter and Mike Tolbert & Mike Tolbert.
