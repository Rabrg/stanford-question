After each team punted, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery, but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge.
CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete.
A few plays later, on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line, linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton's hands while sacking him, and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown, giving the team a 10â€“0 lead.
This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season.
