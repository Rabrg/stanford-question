This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes.
Peyton Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft, while Cam Newton was picked first in 2011.
The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other: Cam Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver.
Peyton Manning and Cam Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Peyton Manning was 39, Cam Newton was 26).
