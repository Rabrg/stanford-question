This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes.
Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft, while Newton was picked first in 2011.
The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver.
Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26).
