In the United States, the game was televised by CBS, as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL.
The network's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest, with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines.
CBS introduced new features during the telecast, including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360â€”an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and "bullet time" effects.
(An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV; for Super Bowl 50, the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution.)
