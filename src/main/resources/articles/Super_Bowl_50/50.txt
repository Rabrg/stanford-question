There would be no more scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth, the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line.
On the next play, Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning's hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line.
A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano's 39-yard field goal, cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16â€“10.
The next three drives of the game would end in punts.
