On Carolina's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line.
However, the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock.
The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt.
After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line.
But with 11 seconds left, Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half.
