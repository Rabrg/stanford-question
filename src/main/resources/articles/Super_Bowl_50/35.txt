As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes of its late night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning with a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game.
Following a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden.
