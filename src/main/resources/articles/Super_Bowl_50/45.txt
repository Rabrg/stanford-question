Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell.
A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina's defense dug in over the next three plays.
First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss.
Then after an incompletion, Thomas Davis tackled C. J. Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3â€“0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal.
The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit.
