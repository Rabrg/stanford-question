As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants.
Elway stated, "We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms."
The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's last game as Denver QB, when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19.
In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys, which was their primary color at the time.
They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys, but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys, losing in Super Bowl XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII.
The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior.
The Broncos' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform: black jerseys with silver pants.
