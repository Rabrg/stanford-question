In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.
A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors, but still may need the city council to help fund the event.
Additional funding will be provided by the city council, which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event.
